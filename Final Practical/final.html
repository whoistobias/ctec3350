              <div class="content">
                <p>These days, just about every food you can think of has a gluten-free alternative, from bagels to pasta to Girl Scout cookies. Heck, we've rounded up our fair share of gluten-free pizza, pancake, and muffin recipes. However its prevalence has resulted in a lot of misconceptions. Gluten-free is often thought of as a fad—or broadly associated with being "healthy"—and not everyone stops to think about what it actually means or why one should or shouldn't eat it.</p>

The coffee press was patented by Milanese designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. It underwent several design modifications through Faliero Bondanini, who patented his own version in 1958 and began manufacturing it in a French clarinet factory called Martin SA, where its popularity grew. Its popularity may have been aided in 1965 by its use in the Michael Caine film The Ipcress File. The device was further popularized across Europe by a British company by the name of Household Articles Ltd. and the Danish tableware and kitchenware company Bodum.</p>
                <p>The modern French press consists of a narrow cylindrical beaker, usually made of glass or clear plastic, equipped with a metal or plastic lid and plunger that fits tightly in the cylinder and has a fine stainless steel wire or nylon mesh filter...</p>
